          <p>
            A Superfund Site is a designated piece of land that the Environmental Protection Agency has declared a danger due to hazardous waste or other hazardous materials embedded in the soil and ecosystem. In 1980, the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act was amended which gave the rights to the EPA to oversee the cleanup of sites across the United States. The EPA was tasked with the responsibility of conducting cleanup actions to protect community and environmental health. Either the party responsible for the damage (such as a chemical company) or the EPA are tasked with cleaning up the site; in either case, the clean-up process is a long and complicated one. Through a novel analysis of data on the EPA website, we have found that it takes an average of 5744 days for a single site to reach ‘completion’, indicating it no longer a hazardous to health or environment. For sites that haven’t reached completion, progress has been ongoing for an average of 11,271 days -- almost double the amount of time taken on completedsites; in short, when progress stalls, it stalls hard.  Through this project we are hoping to allow journalists and concerned citizens alike to easily identify sites that are stalling, investigate why, and hold responsible parties accountable.

          <p>All data used for this project is from the <a href="https://www.epa.gov/superfund">EPA's
            Superfund Program</a>. Data was scraped from the EPA website on May 23rd, 2021 and at the time
            of publishing this website, June 3rd, 2021, the total number of days on list calculation is up to date
            and all other info is from the scrape on the 23rd. While the milestone timeline visualization on each
            site page displays each milestone as-is from EPA data, in the caluclations done for the stats
            and graphs, any milestone that was out of chronological order was dropped. This did not have a
            large effect on overall themes or calculations. See the <a href='home-about.html'>about page</a>
            for more information about this project.</p>
